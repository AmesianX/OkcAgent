OkcAgent acts as a bridge/proxy between Termux and OpenKeychain, enabling you to perform crypto operations in Termux using your keys stored in OpenKeychain, like:

* authenticate SSH connections
* sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt messages

OkcAgent implements the existing protocols in this field so you can seamlessly integrate it with other command line utilities like ssh and git.
